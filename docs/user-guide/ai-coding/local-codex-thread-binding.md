# Bind Local Codex Sessions

Wework can bind an existing local Codex session as a Wework conversation. After binding, Wework stores the local Codex thread id, and follow-up messages sent from Wework continue that same local Codex thread.

## Requirements

- The local device must be online and accessible to the current Wework account.
- The local executor and your existing Codex App or Codex CLI must use the same `CODEX_HOME`. If `CODEX_HOME` differs, Wework may not see the local thread you want to bind.
- Wework reads thread summaries only, such as title, directory, and updated time. It does not import the full Codex history from before binding.

## Take Over On Desktop

1. In Wework desktop, open **Local Codex sessions** from the dedicated **Codex** area in the left sidebar.
2. Choose an online local device from the device cards. When multiple devices are online, the dialog reads the local Codex session count for each device, but does not merge sessions across devices.
3. Review local Codex sessions grouped by project under the selected device. Wework first matches the session working directory to a project; when the session comes from a Codex worktree, it matches the worktree directory name back to the source project; unmatched sessions appear under **Unmatched project**.
4. Choose the Codex session to take over and click **Take over**. Wework creates or opens the matching Wework task.

Subagent sessions are hidden. Running local Codex sessions remain visible with a **Running** state, but cannot be taken over until they finish.

## Continue On Mobile

After binding, mobile does not need a separate import step. Open the bound Wework task and send follow-up messages.

Execution still runs on the bound local device. When continuing from mobile, the local device must remain online and able to access the same `CODEX_HOME` and working directory.
