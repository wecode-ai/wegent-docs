# Wework Chat State Sources

This document records the state sources for the Wework chat path. The goal is to make UI code read one explicit derived status instead of letting the send button, message stream, queue, and runtime task list override each other.

## Core Principles

1. `useWorkbenchPaneSession` is the state boundary for a chat pane.
2. `paneSession.status` is the only chat runtime status entry point for layouts.
3. `runtimePaneMessages.ts` only converts runtime stream events into message actions.
4. `runtimePaneStatus.ts` derives runtime status from messages, the local send phase, and the runtime work execution snapshot.
5. Compatibility fields `paneSession.sending` and `paneSession.waitingForAssistant` must be derived from `paneSession.status`; they must not become independent state again.

## State Source Inventory

| State                                 | Single Source                                                                                                          | Derived Values / Consumers                                                                                         | Maintenance Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Runtime Event Flow

1. A new message submit sets `sendPhase` to `submitting`.
2. After runtime accepts the request, `sendPhase` becomes `awaiting_assistant`.
3. `chat:start` becomes `assistant_started`; the reducer creates or updates the assistant streaming message and `sendPhase` returns to `idle`.
4. `chat:chunk` and block events update only `messages`.
5. Codex `thread/tokenUsage/updated` events update only `projectChat.contextUsage`; they must not create empty messages or write transcript data.
6. When opening a historical task, `runtime.tasks.transcript.contextUsage` only restores the current task's `projectChat.contextUsage`; UI code must not add extra fallbacks that rescan messages or task lists.
7. `chat:done`, `chat:error`, and cancellation events settle the assistant message through the reducer and refresh the work list.
8. If runtime work and message state disagree, do not settle it with fallback logic; fix the missing stream event, transcript data, or reducer action.

### Web Search Tool Blocks

A Codex web search may not include its query action in `item/started`; the final `action` can arrive only in `item/completed`. The executor must update the same block id, settle its status as `done`, and write the final `action` into `tool_input`. Otherwise Wework keeps showing a running web search whose expanded details are empty. Live events and historical transcripts must produce the same `web_search` tool block shape.

The Wework presentation layer accepts both Responses API snake_case action names (`open_page`, `find_in_page`) and Codex app-server camelCase names (`openPage`, `findInPage`). Normalize this naming difference at the tool-detail parsing boundary; do not mask missing completion events with UI placeholder content or status fallbacks.

### Tool Activity Preview Scrolling

The collapsed tool activity preview shows at most three rows and follows the latest activity while no tool detail is expanded. Auto-scroll must react both to changes in the tool row count and to the bottom “Thinking” row appearing or disappearing. When a tool completes without changing the row count, the thinking row must remain inside the inner scroll area's visible range. Expanding a detail removes the preview height limit, so forced scrolling must not override the user's reading position in that state.

## Goal and Task Execution State

The goal bar's running presentation must be constrained by the current runtime task execution snapshot. When App Server explicitly reports `running: false` for the current task, an otherwise `active` goal must be derived as `paused` in the UI and its displayed elapsed time must stop. This prevents an interrupted task from showing an active, ticking goal when it is reopened.

- Task execution is known only when `running` is an explicit boolean. A missing field means the state is unknown and must not pause the goal.
- This derivation affects only Wework presentation and elapsed-time calculation; it does not automatically call the goal pause API. Persisting `paused` remains an explicit user action through **Pause goal**.
- When the task reports `running: true` again, the goal uses the original status returned by the runtime goal API.

When the user stops the current response for a task with an active goal, Wework must persist
`paused` through the runtime goal API before cancelling the current turn. This ordering disables
the automatic continuation source before the turn ends, so the goal cannot start another turn in
the window before its pause request arrives. If pausing the goal fails, Wework must not mark the
current response as stopped. While goal details are still loading, the stop flow must use the
`goalStatus` from the task-list snapshot to decide whether to pause; it must not skip persistence
merely because the goal bar has not rendered yet.

## Composer Mode Indicators

When the composer is in plan mode or goal-draft mode, its bottom mode pill must show a semantic icon to the left of its label: a checklist for plan mode and a target for goal draft. Desktop and compact layouts must reuse the same mode-pill implementation so the state is expressed consistently.

The mode pill's cancel button appears only on hover and is absolutely positioned over the left icon while that icon fades out. Do not expand the cancel button or add spacing that changes the pill width, because that causes the label to shift horizontally.

## Long Output Memory Boundary

The Wework chat UI must not keep complete long-running output in React state. `WorkbenchMessage.content`, thinking/text/plan block `content`, and tool block `toolOutput` must enter `messages` through the shared preview-window path:

- After runtime stream events reach `reduceWorkbenchMessages`, content above the threshold keeps only a tail preview and records `contentTruncated`, `contentOriginalChars`, or `toolOutputTruncated`, `toolOutputOriginalChars`.
- Historical messages returned by `runtime.tasks.transcript` must apply the same truncation semantics by default so refreshes or task switches do not load complete large strings back into the WebView.
- When the user clicks "load full output", the frontend calls the same runtime transcript method with `includeFullContent: true`. The executor returns the complete transcript with `fullContent: true`; the current pane replaces its preview messages with full messages and clears pagination/gap state, so later expanded controls reuse the full state instead of taking another long path.
- `MessageList` and `ToolBlocksDisplay` may only render the current preview and truncation notice; hiding complete content with CSS does not count as releasing memory.
- Right-side temporary chats must reuse the same reducer and stream-action batching path instead of accumulating full output for temporary threads.

## Guidance Message Order

Running Codex LocalTasks can send a queued message as native guidance. Guidance is user input inside the current turn, not a new follow-up turn, so the UI must insert the local user message inside the active assistant as soon as guidance sending starts:

1. Mark the matching `queuedMessages` item as `sending` and show the "正在引导当前对话" notice.
2. Create the user message with the same local message id and `createdAt`, then split the current streaming assistant into two messages.
3. Freeze the before-guidance assistant as done and remove its `subtaskId`, so later stream events cannot write into it.
4. Keep the original `subtaskId` on the after-guidance assistant, and insert a `conversation_guidance` tool block first to mark the guidance position.
5. Later `chat:chunk` and `chat:done` events may carry full text, so trim the assistant text prefix recorded at split time before sending them to the reducer.

Do not append the user message to the bottom after guidance succeeds, and do not wait for `runtime.tasks.guidance` to return before splitting the assistant. Assistant text generated while the guidance request is waiting would otherwise appear before the user guidance message, making live streaming order differ from refreshed transcript order.

## Right-Side Temporary Chats

The right workspace **Temporary chat** feature starts a short side conversation next to the current local Codex thread. It is not a fork and it is not a normal runtime task shown in the left task list:

- Each temporary chat tab has an independent `chat:<id>` instance id, so the right workspace can hold multiple temporary chats at the same time.
- UI state lives inside `TemporaryChatPanel`, using the instance id as the `conversationKey` before a runtime thread exists. Hidden temporary chat tabs stay mounted so local messages and input state are not lost when switching tabs.
- Attachment selection, upload progress, and errors are also isolated per temporary-chat instance and must not reuse the main composer attachment state. The first message passes that instance's attachments explicitly to `createTemporaryRuntimeTask`.
- When a temporary chat is the only open right-workspace tab, the panel defaults to a compact `420px` width. Opening another workspace tab restores the general split default, while a user-resized width remains authoritative.
- The first message calls `createTemporaryRuntimeTask`, creating an `ephemeral` runtime task with the current main thread as `sideSource`. This task does not enter the left task list and does not navigate the main pane.
- Follow-up messages must continue the already loaded temporary thread. The Codex app-server path uses `direct_thread_id` and calls `turn/start` directly; it must not use the normal `resume_thread_id` / `thread/resume` path, because temporary threads do not have rollout mappings and would otherwise fail with `no rollout found`.
- Temporary chats reuse only the current workspace and current thread context. If no main thread source is available, sending should be blocked and the user should be asked to open an existing conversation first.
- After a runtime-work refresh, the reducer must hydrate the current task address with the authoritative `threadId/runtimeHandle` from the same device and task. Keeping an optimistic address without its thread merely because the device is still online prevents the temporary chat from establishing `sideSource`.

Maintenance rule: do not add UI fallbacks that insert temporary chats into the left task list, and do not fabricate rollout records for temporary threads in the executor. The primary path is `ephemeral + sideSource + direct_thread_id`.

After changing this path, run `pnpm --dir wework e2e:desktop:side-chat-attachment`. The scenario creates a real main thread, asserts an approximately `420px` side panel, uploads and sends an attachment from the side chat, and verifies that the main composer never inherits that attachment. It writes screenshots for each critical stage to `wework/test-results/desktop-e2e/<run-id>/`.

## Top-Level Page Transitions

The workbench owns live state that cannot be serialized reliably, including composer drafts, Terminal sessions, and the in-app browser. When users move from the workbench to plugins, apps, or iframe apps, `AppRoutes` must keep `WorkbenchProvider` and `WorkbenchPage` mounted and only hide the workbench surface. Returning to the workbench then reuses the original component instances. A direct visit to an auxiliary page may defer the initial workbench mount to avoid creating unused background sessions.

Do not unmount the workbench during route transitions, and do not add incomplete restoration fallbacks for Terminal or browser state. New top-level pages should join the auxiliary-page rendering branch without changing the workbench lifecycle.

## Workbench Pane Cache

The desktop workbench caches up to 20 regular panes so messages, composer drafts, and local UI state survive switches between parallel tasks. Once the limit is exceeded, inactive panes are evicted in least-recently-used order. Panes for running tasks and panes with pinned terminals remain mounted outside the regular cache limit until the task finishes or the terminal is unpinned. Maintain this boundary through the existing `CachedWorkbenchPaneStack` LRU and pinning mechanisms; do not add a second pane cache in the layout.

## Audit Result

- Desktop and mobile layouts no longer scan `messages` directly to decide whether the assistant is streaming; they read `paneSession.status.isAssistantStreaming`.
- Composer disabled state no longer reads independent `paneSession.sending`; it reads `paneSession.status.isSubmitting`.
- Message waiting indicators no longer combine `sending || waitingForAssistant`; they read `paneSession.status.isWaitingForAssistantIndicator`.
- Queue advancement no longer uses scattered `currentRuntimeTask && !busy`; it reads `paneSession.status.canSendQueuedMessage`.
- `currentRuntimeTaskRunning` is derived through `getRuntimePaneTaskExecution`, avoiding another implementation of runtime running lookup.
- `runtimePaneMessages.ts` no longer owns active assistant lookup; status queries are centralized in `runtimePaneStatus.ts`.

## Maintenance Rules

- Add new chat runtime state by extending `RuntimePaneStatus` first, then read it from layouts or components.
- Do not recompute `assistant streaming`, `busy`, or `can send queued message` in layouts.
- Do not add independent `isSending`, `isRunning`, or `isStreaming` React state unless it represents a new external fact source and this document is updated.
- When runtime work and message state disagree, do not override display inside UI components and do not add fallback settlement; fix the primary path.
