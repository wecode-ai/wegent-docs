## 🎯 Overview

### What is an Agent?

An **Agent** is your AI assistant in Wegent. It can:

- Execute development tasks
- Answer questions
- Review code
- Generate documentation
- And much more...

### Architecture

```
Agent = Bot(s) + Collaboration Mode

Bot = Executor + Model + Prompt + Tools
```

| Component    | Description                | Example                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Agent**    | User-facing AI assistant   | "Code Assistant"         |
| **Bot**      | Building block of an Agent | "Frontend Developer Bot" |
| **Executor** | Runtime environment        | ClaudeCode, Dify, Chat   |
| **Model**    | AI brain                   | Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o  |
| **Prompt**   | Personality & expertise    | System instructions      |
| **Tools**    | External capabilities      | GitHub MCP, Skills       |

## 🧩 Agents in collaboration projects

Wegent Web and Wework use the same agent creation form in collaboration projects. The form keeps four independent dimensions:

| Dimension             | Meaning                                    | Examples                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent source**      | Where the agent definition is stored       | Current project, shared agent                             |
| **Hosting mode**      | Which class of environment hosts the agent | Device execution, Wegent-managed                          |
| **Executor type**     | Which runtime the agent uses               | Codex, Claude Code                                        |
| **Capability source** | How Skills, Plugins, and MCP are obtained  | Follow the runtime device, manually selected capabilities |

These four dimensions are independent. **Wegent-managed is a hosting mode, not an Agent source or executor type.** A shared agent retains its hosting mode, executor, and capability configuration in its own definition, while the project stores a reference to it. A shared agent may be dispatched to an eligible device or hosted by Wegent. An agent created in the current project stores its executor, model, system prompt, and capability requirements directly from the form.

### Capability sources

- **Follow the runtime device**: the task uses the Plugins, Skills, MCP servers, and local capabilities available to the current user on whichever device runs it. The agent is not permanently bound to the device used during creation.
- **Manually select capabilities**: the selected Plugins, Skills, and MCP configuration are saved with the agent. Before a task starts, the system selects or prepares an eligible execution device and synchronizes those capabilities into its runtime.

The system prompt editor uses the same reference interaction as the task composer. Supported capability references can be inserted with `@` or `/`. A reference expresses a capability requirement; it does not implicitly bind the agent to the current computer.

| **Integrations** | Git tokens                  |

### Quick Access

- From the chat interface, click the **gear icon** next to the agent selector
- Or click **Manage** in the agent dropdown

---

## 🚀 Creating an Agent

### Step 1: Open Creation Dialog

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team** tab
2. Click **New Team** button

### Step 2: Basic Information

| Field                   | Required | Description                         |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Name**                | Yes      | Agent name (e.g., "Code Assistant") |
| **Description**         | No       | What this agent does                |
| **Icon**                | No       | Visual identifier                   |
| **Bind Mode**           | Yes      | Where agent appears (Chat/Code)     |
| **Requires Repository** | No       | Need code repo to work?             |

#### Bind Mode Options

| Mode     | Description                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Chat** | Appears in Chat mode for conversations |
| **Code** | Appears in Code mode for development   |
| **Both** | Available in both modes                |

### Step 3: Select Collaboration Mode

Choose how your agent works:

| Mode           | Bots | Best For                |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| **Solo**       | 1    | Simple tasks, beginners |
| **Pipeline**   | 2+   | Sequential workflows    |
| **Coordinate** | 2+   | Parallel analysis       |

The web UI currently offers Solo, Pipeline, and Coordinate when creating or editing agents.

**Recommendation**: Start with **Solo** mode for simplicity.

### Step 4: Configure Bot

For **Solo** mode, configure the bot directly:

1. **Name**: Bot identifier
2. **Executor**: Select runtime (ClaudeCode, Chat, Dify)
3. **Bind Model**: Select AI model
4. **Prompt**: Define personality and expertise
5. **MCP Config**: Add external tools (optional)
6. **Skills**: Add capabilities (optional)

For **other modes**, select existing bots or create new ones.

### Step 5: Save

Click **Save** to create your agent. It will appear in your agent list.

## 🧰 Shared Base Capabilities

When an agent is created with the simple form, **Use shared base capabilities** is enabled by default. The custom agent reuses the general Skills, MCP tools, and plugins configured on the system default agent while keeping its own name, system prompt, model, and executor.

- This works with Chat, Claude Code, Codex, and other supported executors; it does not require switching to Chat Shell.
- Wegent merges the base capabilities into the custom agent configuration and performs one model execution. It does not invoke the default agent first and the custom agent second.
- Same-name MCP and plugin entries from the custom agent take precedence, while Skills are deduplicated.
- Only one inheritance level is supported to keep capability resolution predictable.
- Enabling the option provides more capabilities but can increase context size, tool discovery, and tool-call usage. Disable it for pure chat or minimal executions that do not need these capabilities.
- In **Follow runtime device** mode, Wegent uses the current user's capabilities on the execution device and does not load fixed Ghost capabilities.

After saving, the UI continues to show the Skills available to the agent. During execution, the merged capability configuration is cached within the request so prompt, Skill, MCP, and plugin assembly do not repeat the same reads.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: What's the difference between Agent and Bot?

- **Agent**: User-facing AI assistant (what you interact with)
- **Bot**: Building block of an Agent

An Agent can have one Bot (Solo) or multiple Bots (other modes).

### Q: Which collaboration mode should I use?

| Scenario            | Mode       |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| Simple tasks        | Solo       |
| Sequential workflow | Pipeline   |
| Parallel analysis   | Coordinate |

### Q: Can I edit an Agent after creation?

Yes! Click **Edit** on any agent to modify it.

### Q: Why doesn't my Agent appear in Chat/Code?

Check **Bind Mode** setting - enable Chat and/or Code as needed.

### Q: How do I share an Agent?

1. Click **Share** on the agent
2. Copy the share link
3. Others can add it to their list

### Q: What's "Requires Repository"?

- **Enabled**: Must select a code repo before starting
- **Disabled**: Can work without a repo

Enable for development agents, disable for chat agents.

### Q: Does enabling shared base capabilities make two model calls?

No. Wegent reads the custom Ghost and its base Ghost, merges their Skills, MCP tools, and plugins, and sends one final model request. The base Ghost's system prompt does not override the custom agent's identity.
