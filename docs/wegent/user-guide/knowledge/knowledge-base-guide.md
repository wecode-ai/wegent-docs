## 🔪 Chunking Strategies

### Available Strategies

| Strategy | Best For | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Smart Chunking** | General documents | Auto-detect structure |
| **Sentence-based** | FAQ, Q&A content | Split by sentence boundaries |
| **Semantic** | Long articles | Split by semantic similarity |

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **chunk_size** | 128-8192 | 500 | Characters per chunk |
| **chunk_overlap** | 0-2048 | 50 | Overlapping characters |

See [Chunking Strategies](./chunking-strategies.md) for detailed guide.

## 🔍 Retrieval Test

For smaller knowledge bases, the system may also use an `all-chunks` direct injection path to load the full chunk set into the model. This exists mainly to compensate for cases where vector retrieval recall is not stable enough.

See [Retrieval And Direct Injection](./retrieval-and-direct-injection.md) for the design rationale and permission model.

Before saving retrieval configuration, you can test the retrieval effectiveness.

### How to Use

1. Go to Knowledge Base **Retrieval Settings**
2. Configure retrieval parameters
3. Enter a test query in the **Retrieval Test** area
4. Click **Test** button
5. Review returned chunks and relevance scores
6. Adjust parameters based on results
7. Click **Save** when satisfied

## 📝 Summary Features

### Document Summaries

When enabled, the system automatically generates summaries for each document:

1. Document is uploaded and indexed
2. Summary model processes content
3. Summary stored with document metadata
4. Available for quick reference

### Knowledge Base Summary

Generate an aggregate summary of the entire Knowledge Base:

1. Navigate to Knowledge Base settings
2. Click **Generate Summary**
3. View combined summary of all documents

#### Manually Editing Knowledge Base Summary

Knowledge base summaries can be edited manually to correct AI-generated content, add missing context, or rewrite the summary in a form that better fits team usage.

- Manual summary takes priority in UI display
- Manual summary takes priority when injected into knowledge-base chat context
- AI summary generation continues running in the background
- Use **Restore AI Summary** to switch back to the latest AI-generated summary

**Notes:**

- The current version only supports manual editing of the knowledge base long summary
- Document summaries are still generated automatically
- If **Auto Generate Summary** is disabled, new AI summaries stop updating, but saved manual summary content can still be displayed

### Summary Retry

If summary generation fails:

1. Find the document with failed summary
2. Click **Retry Summary** button
3. System will attempt to regenerate

## 🔐 Permission Management

Knowledge bases support fine-grained access control through the Share Service architecture. You can manage members, assign roles, and authorize external entities (e.g., groups) to access your knowledge bases.

### Member Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, can transfer ownership and manage all members |
| **Maintainer** | Can manage documents, settings, and invite members |
| **Developer** | Can read and contribute documents |
| **Reporter** | Read-only access |

### Managing Members

1. Open a knowledge base and click **Permission Management**
2. Under the **Personal** tab, invite users by username or email
3. Assign a role from the dropdown (Owner, Maintainer, Developer, Reporter)
4. Click **Add** to send the invitation

### Entity-Level Authorization

In addition to individual users, you can authorize entire groups or namespaces:

1. Switch to the **Group** tab in the permission dialog
2. Search for a group or namespace
3. Select the desired group and assign a role
4. All members of that group inherit the assigned permissions

**Note:** Entity-authorized knowledge bases appear in the members' **Shared with Me** section rather than under the group's native knowledge bases.

### Permission Source Visualization

When viewing members, the system displays how each member gained access:

- **Direct** — Added directly as a member
- **Entity** — Access granted through a group or namespace
- **Link** — Access obtained via a share link

### Role Conflict Resolution

When a user has multiple access paths to the same knowledge base (e.g., direct membership and group membership), the system automatically resolves conflicts by selecting the highest-privilege role.

### Ownership Transfer

Owners can transfer ownership to another member:

1. In **Permission Management**, locate the target member
2. Click **Transfer Ownership** next to their name
3. Confirm the transfer in the dialog

The previous owner is downgraded to Maintainer, and the new owner gains full control.

## 🔄 Automatic DingTalk document updates

Enable **Automatically update DingTalk documents** under **Advanced settings** when creating or editing a knowledge base (off by default). A daily scan checks the source update time of existing and subsequently imported DingTalk copies. Successful, available copies are skipped when the saved timestamp is unchanged, or when the source reports no update time while a baseline exists; all other copies are reimported, including copies without a baseline, and the refresh establishes that baseline only when DingTalk reports an update time. The scan runs daily at 02:00 Asia/Shanghai (18:00 UTC); when the service is unavailable at that time, the run waits for the next schedule instead of catching up.

- Each copy uses its original importer's DingTalk authorization. That account must remain active and retain permission to maintain documents in the target knowledge base.
- Copies remain shared under the target knowledge base's permissions. New documents in source folders are not imported automatically. Source deletion or revoked access does not delete the Wegent document record.
- Updates use the same processing flow as manual reimport. Content may be unavailable during an update. Failures appear through the existing error and retry controls and are attempted again in a later cycle.
- Disabling the setting skips automatic jobs that have not started; processing already underway finishes. Manual reimport remains available.
- A failed timestamp probe preserves the available copy. Failed processing remains retryable even if the source timestamp is unchanged. Manual reimport always updates and invalidates the old automatic comparison baseline.

The document list offers **Sync now** on DingTalk copies so the latest source body can be fetched without waiting for the daily scan; the entry reads **Retry sync** when the source is unavailable or indexing failed, and is disabled with **Syncing** while a refresh is in flight. A source that has been deleted or lost access marks the copy **Source unavailable**, and a failed latest sync marks it **Synchronization failed**. A previously imported copy keeps its existing body and index when source probing or body fetching fails. If conversion or indexing fails after a new body is attached, the copy may be temporarily unavailable. The mark clears once the source is reachable again and a sync succeeds.

Fetching a fresh body still requires the node to be present in the original importer's local DingTalk directory. If that directory entry is missing, sync fails; sync the DingTalk directory again before retrying the copy. A missing local entry alone does not establish that the DingTalk source file was deleted.

This first version accepts delayed DingTalk MCP `updateTime` values: content may change before the timestamp does, causing a scan to skip it; a copy whose source stops reporting a time keeps its saved baseline and stays skipped until a time is reported again. After rollout, observe timestamp delays by format, persistently unchanged nodes, and actual content freshness. This behavior was observed with online documents; recovery on the next cycle is not guaranteed. Use manual reimport when an immediate update is needed; the backend sync trigger still applies timestamp comparison.

Deployment requires `SCHEDULED_TASKS_ENABLED` plus `DINGTALK_SYNC_SCHEDULE_ENABLED` (off by default), which is what registers the daily schedule; run Celery Beat and a Worker consuming the default queue. Restart these processes after upgrading to load the new tasks. The manual trigger does not depend on `DINGTALK_SYNC_SCHEDULE_ENABLED`. No database migration is needed.

For testing, an authenticated knowledge-base manager can call `POST /api/knowledge-bases/{knowledge_base_id}/dingtalk-sync` with no request body after enabling automatic updates. It queues the same daily scan for that knowledge base only; workers retain each copy's original importer authorization. HTTP 202 with `{"task_id":"...","status":"queued"}` means queued, not successfully updated. Check document processing results in the document list. A disabled setting returns 400, insufficient management permission returns 403, and enqueue failure returns 503. A Worker is required, but there is no need to wait for the next Beat tick.
