# Interactive Form Defer Flow

This document describes the standard render and resume flow for the `interactive_form_question` MCP tool. The flow lets an Agent show a structured form while running, then continue from a later user message after the user submits the form.

## Design Goals

Interactive forms must follow these constraints:

- MCP remains the only tool entry point. Argument validation, duplicate prevention, and form normalization happen in the MCP server.
- The frontend must not render forms from raw tool input. It can only render the `render_payload` written by the backend into the message block.
- After a form is displayed, the current Agent run must stop. Waiting for user input must not be represented as a fake user message.
- After the user submits the form, the task resumes through the next user message carrying an answer payload.
- A single subtask can successfully display at most one `interactive_form_question` form.

## Standard Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Agent
  participant Proxy as Defer Proxy
  participant MCP as Backend MCP
  participant Store as Message Store
  participant UI as Frontend

  Agent->>Proxy: call interactive_form_question(tool_input)
  Proxy->>MCP: forward MCP call
  MCP->>MCP: validate and normalize questions
  MCP->>Store: write tool block render_payload
  MCP-->>Proxy: deferred tool result
  Proxy-->>Agent: stop current run as tool_deferred
  UI->>Store: read message blocks
  UI->>UI: render form from render_payload
  UI->>Store: submit next user message with answer payload
  Agent->>Agent: resume from user answer
```

## MCP Output Contract

When `interactive_form_question` successfully displays a form, the MCP server must write `render_payload` to the tool block:

```json
{
  "type": "interactive_form_question",
  "ask_id": "ask_123",
  "task_id": 1,
  "subtask_id": 2,
  "questions": []
}
```

The tool result is only used to tell the runtime to stop the current run:

```json
{
  "__deferred_user_input__": true,
  "success": true,
  "status": "waiting_for_user_response",
  "ask_id": "ask_123"
}
```

The frontend may render only when all of these are true:

- The block is an `interactive_form_question` tool block.
- The block has a valid `render_payload`.
- `render_payload.type` is `interactive_form_question`.
- `render_payload.questions` is a non-empty array.

The frontend must not read raw tool input to render a form. Raw input can contain invalid fields produced by the model; only the MCP-normalized payload is a trusted UI schema.

## Chat Shell Behavior

After Chat Shell calls the tool, if the tool result satisfies the defer contract:

- Emit the tool done event so the message block is complete.
- Raise an internal deferred exit to stop the current ReAct run.
- Wait for the user's next message.

Do not write the deferred result as user content, and do not inject “pending user input” into the model context.

## Claude Code Behavior

Claude Code uses `deferred_mcp_proxy` only for MCP tools whose name contains `interactive_form_question`. All other MCP tools continue to use the Claude Code SDK's native path.

The proxy flow is:

1. The SDK hook catches the `interactive_form_question` tool call.
2. The proxy forwards the original arguments to Backend MCP.
3. Backend MCP validates the payload, writes `render_payload`, and returns a deferred result.
4. The response processor emits tool done and ends the turn with `stop_reason=tool_deferred`.

## User Answer Validation

Before accepting a later user message, Backend checks whether the current task has a pending interactive form:

- If no form is pending, form answers are rejected.
- If a form is pending, ordinary text messages are rejected until the user submits or cancels the form.
- The answer payload must include `type=interactive_form_question` and the matching `tool_use_id`.

This prevents ordinary chat messages from being treated as form results and keeps invalid form answers out of model context.

## Skill Publishing Authentication

Skill creation scripts use `WEGENT_SKILL_IDENTITY_TOKEN` to publish generated Skills at task runtime. This token is a Skill runtime identity, not a general login token.

Skill publishing APIs must support this token:

- `GET /api/v1/kinds/skills`: used by publish scripts to check for an existing Skill, especially with `exact_match=true`.
- `POST /api/v1/kinds/skills/upload`: create a Skill.
- `PUT /api/v1/kinds/skills/{skill_id}`: overwrite an existing Skill.

General business APIs should not accept `WEGENT_SKILL_IDENTITY_TOKEN` by default, otherwise the Skill runtime identity would become a general user credential.
